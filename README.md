# ISO14229-1 Unified Diagnostic Protocol
![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/devcoons/iso14229/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg)  

*Compiler flags: **-O3 -Wfatal-errors -Wall -std=c11***

An implementation of the **ISO14229-1 (UDS)** protocol in a platform agnostic C library. The library interacts in a transparent way with the lower ISO layers which means that the user must define the connection for the reception and the transmission of the CANBus TP(ISO15765-2) messages. In this way you have a complete control and reusability of this library in different platforms. This library can work with any layer that requires ISO14229.

>This ISO specifies data link independent requirements of diagnostic services, which allow a diagnostic tester (client) to control diagnostic functions in an on-vehicle electronic control unit (ECU, server) such as an electronic fuel injection, automatic gearbox, anti-lock braking system, etc. connected to a serial data link embedded in a road vehicle.
>It specifies generic services, which allow the diagnostic tester (client) to stop or to resume non-diagnostic message transmission on the data link.
